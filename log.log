- check and clean data
    - drop na
    - denormalize?

- exploratory data analysis
    - correlation heatmaps, linear regression coefficients
    - dataframe statistics per column (Float data has been normalized, not original test results)
        - num of data points, central tendency (if µ = 0 and σ = 1, then normalized)
        - how many of each output (how many + vs how many -)

- data processing and transformation
    - check and clean data

- variable selection
    - based on how many rows with no na
    - what each indicates biologically (focus on oxygen bc COVID is a respiratory disease)
    - based on correlation heatmaps, linear regression coefficients

- prediction model comparison
